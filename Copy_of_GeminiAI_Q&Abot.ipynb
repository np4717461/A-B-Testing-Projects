              "'The history of Bangalore is complex and doesn\\'t have a single definitive founding date.  While settlements existed in the area for centuries, the city\\'s significant growth and development started much later.\\n\\nDifferent sources offer varying timelines:\\n\\n* **Early settlements:** Archaeological evidence suggests settlements in the region dating back to the pre-historic period.  However, these were small, scattered communities, not the city we know today.\\n\\n* **Medieval period:**  The area around present-day Bangalore was under various dynasties for many centuries.  There\\'s evidence of a small town existing around the 16th century.\\n\\n* **Kempegowda\\'s contribution (1537):**  Kempegowda I, the founder of the Yelahanka dynasty, is widely credited with establishing a fortified town in the area in 1537. This is often cited as the beginning of modern Bangalore.  However, it was still a relatively small settlement at that time.\\n\\n* **Subsequent growth:**  The city\\'s growth accelerated significantly under subsequent rulers, particularly Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan in the 18th century.  Its strategic location and expanding trade contributed to its development.\\n\\n* **British era:** The British East India Company\\'s control in the 19th century brought about significant infrastructural changes and further expansion of Bangalore.\\n\\nSo, there isn\\'t a single \"age\" for Bangalore.  While a settlement existed in the region for a long time, the city we know today largely emerged from Kempegowda\\'s establishment in **1537**.  However, its history stretches back far beyond that, encompassing centuries of smaller settlements and shifts in control.\\n'"
